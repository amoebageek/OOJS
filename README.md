------------------


These are the topics which i found very much confusing when i started working on the concept of JS,some of the topics and explanations might be silly enough to consider but its true that those doubts were also in my minds when i started.

I'll Try to cover most of the topics related to `Object Oriented Javascript` (`oojs`) In brief in separate directory.
